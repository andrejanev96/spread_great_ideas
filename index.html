    </header>

    <section class="intro clearfix">
        <p>When we compare the two cartridges on paper, the 10mm should blow the 40 S&W out of the water. Lt. Col. Jeff Cooper designed the 10mm to exhibit better external ballistics than the 45 ACP, and the 40 Smith & Wesson was intentionally designed by weakening the 10mm.</p>
        <p>But there might be better choices than the 10mm for you for various reasons. We’ll compare these two cartridges based on their recoil, trajectory, accuracy, stopping power, effectiveness in self-defense, cost and availability, and reloading potential.</p>
        <p>Continue reading to discover if the 10mm Auto is supreme – or if you should use a 40 Smith & Wesson instead!</p>

        <img src="10mm-round.jpg" alt="10mm round" class="round-img">
        <p>The 10mm was created to exhibit better terminal ballistics (i.e., penetration and expansion) than the 9mm Luger, as well as better external ballistics (i.e., effective range and muzzle velocity) than the 45 Automatic Colt Pistol.</p>
        <p>The 40 S&W is a reduced power load based on the 10mm. It was developed in 1990 by Smith & Wesson and Winchester as a rimless centerfire handgun cartridge to meet the FBI’s requirements for an effective defense round.</p>

        <h3>Performance Comparison</h3>
        <article class="clearfix">
            <h4>Recoil</h4>
            <img src="40sw-round.jpg" alt="40 S&W round" class="round-img">
            <p>The average 10mm Auto 180 grain load has around 11.5 ft-lbs (foot-lbs) of recoil, which is 50% more recoil than the 45 Auto.</p>
            <p>The average 40 S&W 180 grain load has a little over 5.1 ft-lbs of recoil. The .40 S&W generally has less than half of the amount of recoil of the 10mm.</p>
            <p>The .40 Smith & Wesson takes an early lead because it has less recoil, allowing for more accurate follow-up shots.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Trajectory</h4>
            <p>The 10mm has a flatter trajectory than the 40 S&W because it’s more powerful.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Accuracy</h4>
            <p>This section is a draw since the 40 S&W has lower recoil and the 10mm has a flatter trajectory.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Stopping Power</h4>
            <p>The 10mm is more powerful than the 40 S&W, thus it has more stopping power. The 10mm wins this section.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Self-Defense</h4>
            <p>The 40 S&W has a lower recoil, making follow-up shots faster and more accurate, giving it a slight edge in self-defense situations.</p>
        </article>

    <section class="conclusion clearfix">
        <h2>Parting Shots: 10mm vs. 40 S&W</h2>
        <p>Now that we’ve finished comparing and contrasting the 10mm vs. 40 S&W, it’s time to tally up the scores and determine the winner.</p>
        <p>The 10mm won two sections (trajectory and stopping power) while the 40 S&W won three sections (recoil, self-defense, cost/availability). Two sections (accuracy and reloadability) were a draw.</p>
        <p>It’s up to you to determine which areas hold more weight for your situation, but I’ll typically lean toward the 40 S&W in most instances.</p>
