    </header>

    <section class="intro clearfix">
        <p>When we compare the two cartridges on paper, the 10mm should blow the 40 S&W out of the water. Lt. Col. Jeff Cooper designed the 10mm to exhibit better external ballistics than the 45 ACP, and the 40 Smith & Wesson was intentionally designed by weakening the 10mm.</p>
        <p>But there might be better choices than the 10mm for you for various reasons. We’ll compare these two cartridges based on their recoil, trajectory, accuracy, stopping power, effectiveness in self-defense, cost and availability, and reloading potential.</p>
        <p>Continue reading to discover if the 10mm Auto is supreme – or if you should use a 40 Smith & Wesson instead!</p>

        <h2>10mm vs. 40 S&W</h2>
        <img src="10mm-round.jpg" alt="10mm round" class="round-img">
        <p>The 10mm was created to exhibit better terminal ballistics (i.e., penetration and expansion) than the 9mm Luger, as well as better external ballistics (i.e., effective range and muzzle velocity) than the 45 Automatic Colt Pistol.</p>
        <p>The 40 S&W is a reduced power load based on the 10mm. It was developed in 1990 by Smith & Wesson and Winchester as a rimless centerfire handgun cartridge to meet the FBI’s requirements for an effective defense round.</p>
        <p>How do these two cartridges compare? Let’s begin with their specs. /p>

        <p>These two rounds’ bullet diameter, neck diameter, and base diameter are virtually identical to the naked eye (the 40 S&W base diameter is 0.001” narrower than the 10mm, and the neck diameter of the 40 is 0.009” narrower than the 10mm). </p>
        <p>The <a href="https://ammo.com/handgun/40-cal-ammo" target="_blank">.40 cal’s</a> shorter case also means it is slightly shorter overall and has a lower case capacity than the 10mm, leading to a lower maximum pressure. </p>
        <p>While these two rounds are visually distinct, they can be easily confused at the range. If you’re firing both cartridges during the same range day, keep them separate to prevent a catastrophe.</p>
        <p>Let’s see how the visual differences equate to real-world performance. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="performance clearfix">
        <article class="clearfix">
            <h4>Recoil</h4>
            <img src="40sw-round.jpg" alt="40 S&W round" class="round-img">
            <p>Bullet weight, firearm weight, muzzle velocity, and propellant weight determine how much recoil a cartridge generates. There is never an apples-to-apples comparison between any cartridge or caliber. That said, we can provide a general idea of how much felt recoil to expect while firing these rounds.
            </p>
            <p>The average 10mm Auto 180 grain load has around 11.5 ft-lbs (foot-lbs) of recoil. To rifle shooters, this doesn’t sound like much, but that’s 50% more recoil than the 45 Auto( another comparable handgun cartridge).</p>
            <p>The average 40 S&W 180 grain load has a little over 5.1 ft-lbs of recoil. In other words, the .40 S&W generally has less than half of the amount of recoil of the 10mm. </p>
            <p>While some shooters do consider it a little snappy, recoil-sensitive individuals should go with the 40 S&W over the 10mm. </p>
            <p>The .40 Smith & Wesson takes an early lead because it has less recoil than the 10mm Auto, allowing for more accurate follow-up shots as it will have less muzzle flip, making it much easier to remain on target or quickly get back on target.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Trajectory</h4>
            <p>Since most self-defense situations happen within 25 yards, the trajectory doesn’t matter all that much, as both calibers will remain relatively flat shooting at that distance. </p>
            <p>However, the 10mm is often used for handgun hunting. In this instance, you will likely need to fire over distances greater than 25 yards, which necessitates careful consideration of bullet drop.</p>
            <p>The 10mm has the advantage, as it has a flatter trajectory than the 40 S&W, simply because it’s more powerful.</p>

        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Accuracy</h4>
            <p>Determining the accuracy of a round is tricky because so many factors must be considered. The shooter’s capabilities, bullet type, firearm, and shooting conditions all play a significant role in determining the round’s accuracy.</p>
            <p>To keep everything as equal as possible, recoil and trajectory are also factors in the equation and are the primary considerations for this article. It is much easier to be accurate with a low-recoil, flat-shooting round than a heavy-recoil, arching round.</p>
            <p>This section is a draw since the 40 S&W has lower recoil, and the 10mm has a flatter trajectory. Recoil-sensitive shooters often find the 40 Smith and Wesson more accurate, while long-range (i.e. anything over 25 yards) shooters often find the 10mm more accurate.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Stopping Power</h4>
            <p>The 10mm is more powerful than the 40 S&W. In the simplest possible terms, it, therefore, has more stopping power. However, both cartridges can neutralize a threat quickly, especially with proper shot placement, which is always more important than the stopping power of a round.</p>
            <p>Bullet design and propellant load are other considerations for stopping power. Jacketed hollow point (JHP) bullets will have greater stopping power than full metal jacket (FMJ) bullets because JHPs expand upon impact, creating a larger wound channel while penetrating deep enough to reach vital organs. </p>
            <p>The 10mm easily wins this section because the 40 S&W was intentionally designed to be less powerful. </p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Self-Defense</h4>
            <p>The 40 S&W and 10mm Auto are both capable self-defense rounds. Full-size semi-auto pistols (like the Glock 20 10mm Auto pistol and the Glock 22 40 S&W pistol), often used for concealed carry, come standard with 10-15 round magazines while remaining reasonably compact.</p>
            <p>While you must concern yourself with over-penetration when using either cartridge in a home defense situation, the 10mm will prove slightly more likely to over-penetrate simply because it’s more powerful than a <a href="https://ammo.com/handgun/40-cal-ammo" target="_blank">40 S&W round</a>.</p>
            <p>Two other considerations for self-defense are ammo availability and cost, as you must regularly train with your CCW to ensure your skills remain sharp. We will discuss those next (spoiler: the 40 S&W is typically less expensive and more readily available). </p>
            <p>I’ll give the 40 S&W the slight edge because it has a lower recoil, making follow-up shots faster, more accurate, and less expensive to fire. The 40 Smith and Wesson regains the lead.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Ammo & Firearm Cost/Availability</h4>
            <img src="glock.jpg" alt="Picture of a Glock 20 or Glock 22" class="round-img">
<p>Generally, larger cartridges will cost more, which holds true for the 10mm and 40 S&W. The cost per round of 10mm Auto ammo is typically higher than 40 S&W of the same brand and bullet type. </p>
<p>The same is true for the cost of the firearms. A Glock 22, chambered in 40 S&W, is slightly less expensive than a Glock 20, chambered in 10mm.</p>
<p>It’s also often much easier to find 40 S&W firearms and ammo, whereas 10mm is less abundant but not especially hard to find (we carry a large assortment of 10mm rounds at Ammo.com). </p>
<p>Whether you’re looking to stock up on a bunch of ammo and guns or just looking for the cheapest option, the 40 S&W wins this section. </p>            
        </article>

        <article>
            <h4>Reloading</h4>
            <p>Both cartridges can be reloaded. Abundant materials and information are available to craft handloads for the 10mm and 40 S&W alike. You can reload the spent casings with either cartridge you decide to purchase, so this section is a draw.</p>

        <h2>10mm vs. .40 S&W Ballistics</h2>
        <h3>10mm Ballistics</h3>
        <p>[Insert Table here]</p>
        <h3>.40 S&W Ballistics</h3>
        <p>[Insert Table here]</p>

        <h3>10mm Brief History</h3>
        <p>Jeff Cooper, Whit Collins and Irving Stone developed the 10 mm Auto in the 1980s. Dornaus & Dixon Enterprises, Inc. and Norma manufactured the Bren Ten 10mm Auto (based on the CZ-75). However, the Bren Ten had several issues (despite being a hit with Don Johnson preferred in Miami Vice). Colt essentially saved the 10mm when it created the 1911 Delta Elite chambered in 10mm.</p>
        <p>Even with the development of the Delta Elite, the 10mm wasn’t gaining popularity with law enforcement or civilians until a shootout in Miami between FBI agents and bank robbers in 1986. After making the 10mm a standard-issued cartridge, the FBI soon realized that the 10mm had too much recoil for many law enforcement officers, giving way to the .40 S&W. </p>
        <p>Today, the 10mm is primarily used for self-defense and handgun hunting. It is much less popular than the <a href="https://ammo.com/comparison/10mm-vs-357" target="_blank">357 Magnum</a>, 45 ACP, and <a href="https://ammo.com/comparison/10mm-vs-9mm" target="_blank"9mm></a>. It sits in a niche segment, much like the 357 SIG. Springfield Armory, Glock, Ruger, and several other manufacturers manufacture 10mm pistols. Buffalo Bore, Hornady, Federal, Underwood, Winchester, and many other reputable ammo makers offer <a href="https://ammo.com/handgun/10mm-ammo" target="_blank">10mm</a> ammo.</p>

        <h3>.40 S&W Brief History</h3>
        <p>The 40 Smith & Wesson was introduced in 1990 as a collaboration between Smith & Wesson, Winchester, and the FBI (to an extent). A standard 40 S&W full metal jacket (FMJ) 165 grain bullet exits the muzzle at a velocity of 1,130 fps and with a muzzle energy of 468 foot-pounds – notably not as much as the 10mm. 
        </p>
        <p>Despite being less powerful than its hard-kicking relative, the 40 S&W became incredibly popular with American law enforcement and concealed carry permit holders.</p>
        <p>Today, the 9mm has surpassed the 40 S&W’s popularity (largely thanks to bullet technology advancements). Some still appreciate the 40's high magazine capacity, solid stopping power, and reduced recoil (compared to the 10mm, at least). </p>


        <h3>Parting Shots: 10mm vs. 40 S&W</h3>
        <p>Now that we’ve finished comparing and contrasting the 10mm vs. 40 S&W, it’s time to tally up the scores and determine the winner.</p>
        <p>Drum roll, please!</p>
        <p>The 10mm won two sections (trajectory and stopping power), while the 40 S&W won three sections (recoil, self-defense, cost/availability). Two sections (accuracy and reloadability) were a draw.</p>
        <p>It’s up to you to determine which areas hold more weight for your situation, but I’ll typically lean toward the 40 S&W in most instances. </p>
